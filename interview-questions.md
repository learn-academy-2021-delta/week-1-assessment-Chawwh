# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Before this question I really thought they were literally the same thing. O.O BUT using context clues I'm able to make a hypothesis that git is a code sharing program while GitHub is more for code storage in a cloud.

  Researched answer: In short, git is a content tracker. It tracks changes made to a repository on a local system and uploads them to the server. It's also capable of version control; making sure the files on local are up to date with what's stored in GitHub. Github is the host for git. It stores the data that git is able to access.



2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: Aha! I feel like you're trying to trip me up here. So I know 'Boolean values' are either true or false. So with that knowledge I can say comparisons made with relational, equality, and logical operators will return a Boolean value.

  Researched answer: Comparison evaluations will return a Boolean value.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: Index is the address of an array while value is more of what is stored at an address.

  Researched answer: Index is the reference to an elements value in an array. Value is used to define the variable held within indexes.
<!--My google search history thought I wanted Index Funds for this question Lol-->


4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: Built-in methods are functions available in javascript.

  Researched answer: Built in methods are functions already built into javascript for users to take advantage of.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: So the roles in pair programming techniques are "driver" and "navigator". The "driver" is the hacker with the cool glasses behind the computer physically typing out the code while the "navigator" is the brains of the operation giving instructions through the earpiece.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is a development technique in which two programming contribute together on the same project. The pair is split into roles of driver and observer. The driver writes the code with the observer reviews each line for errors.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: In my full honest opinion, everything we've done in class this week has been super duper helpful! I've tried learning programming languages on my own and wasn't able to get a whole lot to stick. Having the ability to ask questions and work with a partner on projects is really proving to be a learning method my brain comprehends. ^-^



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration: Loops!!! I remember loops from trying to learn C++

2. Higher Order Functions: Functions that can take other functions as arguments

3. Jest: Looks to be a javascript framwork
<!-- Eww its owned by facebook -->
<!-- I'M KIDDING I USE INSTAGRAM AND MY OCULUS QUEST EVERYDAY -->

4. Objects: I think objects are variables with their own properties?
<!-- I swear I'm researching these! -->

5. Classes: Classes are used to create objects?!
<!-- I like this. I'm very very excited for these!! -->
